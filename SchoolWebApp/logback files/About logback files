1. logback-spring.xml

    Pros:
        Supports Spring Boot-specific features, such as externalized configuration and the use of @PropertySource.
        Allows for more complex and flexible logging configurations.
        Can utilize Spring environment properties directly in the Logback configuration.
    Cons:
        Slightly more complex to set up and maintain than properties or YAML configuration.

2. logback.xml

    Pros:
        Standard Logback configuration file, which is familiar to many developers.
        Suitable for projects that do not require Spring Boot-specific logging features.
    Cons:
        Does not support Spring Boot-specific enhancements.
        Less integration with Spring Bootâ€™s configuration mechanisms.

3. application.properties or application.yml

    Pros:
        Simple and easy to configure.
        Allows developers to keep all configuration in a single place, which can be more convenient.
        Suitable for less complex logging requirements.
    Cons:
        Limited flexibility compared to XML configuration.
        Not suitable for very complex logging setups that require advanced Logback features.

Recommendations

    1. For Simplicity and Ease of Use:

        If you prefer simplicity and your logging requirements are not too complex, using application.properties or application.yml is a good choice.

    2. For Flexibility and Advanced Features:

        If you need more flexibility and advanced logging features, go with logback-spring.xml.

    3. For Standard Use:

           If you are working on a non-Spring Boot project or do not need Spring Boot-specific features, use logback.xml.
           The configuration content will be the same as for logback-spring.xml.

In summary:

    Use application.properties or application.yml for simple setups.
    Use logback-spring.xml for more advanced configurations and when leveraging Spring Boot features.
    Use logback.xml for standard Logback configurations without Spring Boot-specific requirements.
